In addtion, there are no 3rd-party dependencies.

## modules

- math  
   + q_exp ->  giving some fast compute function for exponent  
   + q_rsqrt -> fast compute function for rsqrt, which are used in Quake III

- log   -> a log system, which is easy to use, one header only, and very small.

- reduce  -> quck to implement reduce compute on multidimensional arrays. one header only

- sys  -> some system functions


## Features
- Very small
- Easy to use
- Headers only (most functions depend on only one header )
